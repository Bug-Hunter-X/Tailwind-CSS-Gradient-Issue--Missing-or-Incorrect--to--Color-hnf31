# Tailwind CSS Gradient Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS's gradient utilities.  The problem occurs when the `to` color in a gradient definition is missing or specified incorrectly.

## Problem

The `bug.html` file shows a basic gradient implementation with a missing `to` color.  This leads to an unexpected visual outcome or failure to render the gradient.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file provides a corrected version. It shows how to properly define the gradient with both `from` and `to` colors to ensure the gradient renders correctly.
